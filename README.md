# Food-Service
This project is my version of a food delivery service. It reads in dinner options with their corresponding ingredients from a text file and allows users to pick (currently) 3 options to have sent to their house for dinner that week. Ingredients are added to a vector for each dinner option and removed if there is a food allergy. This repository is a work in progress as my summer project!
